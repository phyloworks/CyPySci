This repository hosts files and materials for a programming study group in the EEOB department at Iowa State University.

For references with incremental homeworks, see [here](https://github.com/sjspielman/UTbiocomputing2015). 

A tutorial on git can be found [here](https://git.lumc.nl/humgen/programming-course/ipython_notebook/82a1fcf6b5abb24243494233577d68c9837221cc/git.ipynb)

We are using the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution of python.
