This repository hosts files and materials for a programming study group in the EEOB department at Iowa State University.

For references with incremental homeworks from the UT BioComputing Course, see [here](https://github.com/sjspielman/UTbiocomputing2015). 

Nice tutorials on scientific computing using python (in iPython Notebooks) are [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/tree/master/).

A tutorial on git can be found [here](https://git.lumc.nl/humgen/programming-course/ipython_notebook/82a1fcf6b5abb24243494233577d68c9837221cc/git.ipynb)

We are using the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution of python.

If you would like to join this group, contact Dr. Heath or Dr. Nason.
